## About Me:

Hello, my name is **Matthew Jarecky**. You may call me *Matt* or *Matthew*, I am fine with either.

I am currently an undergraduate student studying computer engineering at UC San Diego!

My favorite hobbies include:
* Backpacking
* Rocketry
* Sleeping (*I mean, who doesn't enjoy it.*)

Another pastime I enjoy is watching film. My top three films are:
1. *The Shawshank Redemption*
2. *A Silent Voice (聲の形 : Koe no Katachi)*
3. *How to Train Your Dragon*

My favorite quote from *The Shawshank Redemption*. From Andy to Red:
> I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.

## A Fascinating Programming Language:

One day while I was browsing the internet, I stumbled across an esoteric programming language appropriately named Brainf*ck. (_I'll let you guess what the censored word is._) To this day, I am still intrigued by this incredibly simple, yet mind-numbingly confusing language. I encourage you to check it out.

[An introduction to and the basics of Brainf*ck.](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a) --- _Don't worry, my skills are still less than the beginning level in this language._

An exercise for the reader. Can you figure out what this Brainf*ck program prints?
